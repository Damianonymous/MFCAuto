     * @param [username] Either "guest" or a real MFC member account name, default is "guest"

     * This can be either the real password or the password hash as MFCAuto has always taken
     * historically. Client will attempt to auto-detect which type of password you have specified.
     *
     * If your real password looks like a hashed password (exactly 32 alphanumeric characters

     * password. In which case, you can override the auto-detection of password type and
     * force Client to treat it as the real password by specifying `{ forceUnhashedPassword: true }`
     * as part of the constructor options.
     *
     * If you wish to use the hashed password, you can discover it by checking your browser
     * cookies after logging in via your browser.  In Firefox, go to Options->Privacy
     * and then "Show Cookies..." and search for "myfreecams".  You will see one
     * cookie named "passcode". Select it and copy the value listed as "Content".
     * It will be a long string of lower case letters that looks like gibberish.

     * like whether to use WebSockets or traditional TCP sockets and whether to connect

     * reconnect attempt, and rejects when either the given timeout is reached
     * or client.disconnect() is called before we were able to establish a
     * connection. It also rejects if the user has not called .connect at all
